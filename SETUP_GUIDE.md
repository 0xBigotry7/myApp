## Tips

- **No API keys?** The app will work but AI features will be disabled
- **Fallback rates**: Currency conversion works without API key using static rates
- **Receipt uploads**: Works without UploadThing but you won't be able to upload photos
- **Mobile-friendly**: Use on your phone during trips for quick expense entry

## Troubleshooting

### AI features not working
- Check that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly in `.env`
- Restart the dev server after adding the key
- Check the console for API errors

### Receipt upload fails
- Verify `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` and `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` are correct
- Make sure you've created an app on uploadthing.com
- Check file size is under 4MB

### Database errors
- Run `npx prisma db push` again
- Delete `prisma/dev.db` and run setup again
- Check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`

## Next Steps

- **Customize categories**: Edit `CATEGORIES` array in code
- **Change port**: Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` in `.env` and package.json dev script
- **Deploy**: Deploy to Vercel, Railway, or your preferred host
- **Backup**: Regularly backup your `prisma/dev.db` file

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the main [README.md](README.md)
2. Review the code in `lib/ai.ts` for AI features
3. Look at API routes in `app/api/` for endpoints
