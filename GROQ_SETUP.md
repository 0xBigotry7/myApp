## Done! ðŸŽ‰

Your receipt scanning will now be:
- **FREE** - Groq's free tier is very generous (thousands of requests per day)
- **FASTER** - Groq is known for having the fastest inference in the industry
- **BETTER** - Llama 3.2 Vision 90B is excellent at OCR tasks

## What Changed?

- **Old**: OpenAI GPT-4o (slow, requires payment)
- **New**: Groq Llama 3.2 Vision 90B (fast, completely free)

## Free Tier Limits

Groq's free tier includes:
- **14,400 requests per day** (more than enough!)
- **6,000 tokens per minute**
- No credit card required

## Troubleshooting

**"Groq API key not configured" error?**
- Make sure you added `GROQ_API_KEY` to your `.env` file
- Restart your dev server after adding the key
- Check that the key starts with `gsk_`

**Still slow?**
- Groq should be much faster than OpenAI
- If you're still seeing slowness, check your internet connection
- The model processes images in 2-3 seconds typically

## Optional: Remove OpenAI

Since you're not paying for OpenAI anymore, you can:
1. Remove `OPENAI_API_KEY` from your `.env` file
2. Optionally uninstall: `npm uninstall openai`

But keep it if you're using it elsewhere in the app!
