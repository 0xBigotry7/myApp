## Troubleshooting

### AI Features Not Working

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Check `.env` has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- [ ] Verify API key is correct (starts with `sk-ant-`)
- [ ] Restart dev server: Stop (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again
- [ ] Check console for errors (F12 in browser)
- [ ] Check terminal for API errors

### Receipt Upload Fails

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Check `.env` has both `UPLOADTHING_SECRET` and `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID`
- [ ] Verify keys are correct from uploadthing.com dashboard
- [ ] Check file size is under 4MB
- [ ] Restart dev server
- [ ] **Alternative**: Skip receipt uploads (optional feature)

### Database Errors
**Problem**: Errors about database or Prisma

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Delete `prisma/dev.db` file
- [ ] Run `npx prisma db push` again
- [ ] Run `npm run seed` again
- [ ] Restart dev server

### Port Already in Use
**Problem**: Port 3002 is already in use

**Solutions**:
- [ ] Kill process on port 3002: `lsof -ti:3002 | xargs kill`
- [ ] Or change port in `package.json` dev script
- [ ] Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` in `.env` if you change port

### Build Errors
**Problem**: TypeScript or build errors

**Solutions**:

- [ ] Check GitHub issues if problem persists
